            <h2 class="Intro">The space elevator is just a concept, for now. It's just a big elevator that goes all the way to space.
            Building a space elevator has many benefits, but we still have many problems to solve before we can build one.</h2>
            
            <h1 class="Problem">Problems</h1>
            <h2 class="Problem">There are many problems that need solving before we can build a space elevator</h2>
            <ol class="Problem">
            <li>We need a material strong enough to withstand  the forces of gravity</li>
            <li>We need a way to protect the elevator from space debris</li>
            <li>We need to find an efficient way to build it</li>
            </ol>

            <li>Cheaper space travel(Less rocket fuel needed)</li>
            <li>Regular people like you or me can go to space(provided you have money)</li>
            <li>More satellites(better communication)</li>
